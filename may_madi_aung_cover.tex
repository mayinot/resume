\opening{Dear Sir/Madam,}

I currently hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from Singapore Institute Of Technology (SIT). Throughout my education and my previous experience, I am well-versed in developing, code reviews, and unit testing, and I understand the importance of usability testing in delivering exceptional user experiences. These practices ensure software applications' quality, reliability, and usability, and I am eager to contribute my skills in these areas to \companyname. 

As stated in the job description, proficiency in major object-oriented programming languages is required. I have extensive experience in software development and possess strong mathematical and computer skills. I am fluent in \programing, and I have hands-on experience in building MVC applications with ASP.NET (C\#). I am currently working as a .NET developer in GetGo, where I effectively applied object-oriented programming concepts and design patterns to develop software systems.

n addition to technical skills, I \softskill, as emphasized in the job description. My experience as a Junior Developer at GetGo has allowed me to exhibit leadership qualities . As the SCRUM leader, it was my responsibility to assign and monitor Jira tickets. 

Joining \companyname as a \role is an opportunity I wholeheartedly embrace. I have attached my resume, which provides further details on my skills, education, and experiences. Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach me at 8186 1415. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in more detail. Thank you for considering my application.
